SimpleStorage
Overview
A simple Solidity smart contract called SimpleStorage keeps one unsigned integer (favoriteNumber) on the blockchain. Users can access this stored number through a publicly accessible function provided by the contract.
Features
•	Store a single unsigned integer as a state variable.
•	The stored number is publicly accessible.
Smart Contract Details
An unsigned integer can be stored in the state variable favoriteNumber, which is of type uint256 in the contract. It immediately constructs a getter function that enables users to retrieve the value since it is declared public..
Technologies Used
•	Solidity: Programming language for writing smart contracts.
•	Remix IDE: Browser-based Integrated Development Environment for Solidity.
•	Ethereum Blockchain: Deployment environment for the smart contract.
Installation and Setup
1.	Open Remix IDE:
	Go to Remix.
2.	Create a New Solidity File:
	In Remix, create a new file named SimpleStorage.sol.
3.	Copy the Code:
	Paste the above Solidity code into the file.
4.	Compile the Contract:
	In the Remix IDE, navigate to the "Solidity Compiler" tab and compile the contract.
5.	Deploy the Contract:
	Switch to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab, choose the appropriate environment (e.g., JavaScript VM or an Ethereum test network), and deploy the contract.
Usage
Once the contract is deployed:
•	The favoriteNumber can be retrieved directly since it is declared public.
•	You can interact with the contract through Remix or by writing a script to read the value stored in favoriteNumber.
